                    <p>343 Industries and Microsoft Game Studios provide these forums as a service to the Halo community, in an effort to help them connect with each other, discuss Halo and ultimately enhance their gaming experience. It is important to understand that our primary goal in the facilitation of these objectives is to ensure that users can discuss Halo in a safe and friendly environment, providing them with a positive and constructive community framework.</p>
                    <p>The best way to facilitate this is through leading by example. Alternately, when such leadership does not engender appropriate behavior among various members, we have a Services Agreement for all users to follow the Waypoint Forums Guidelines, which can be found here:</p>

                    <p>In your first steps as a moderator of Waypoint, this guide should hopefully help you gain an understanding of the policies and practices that have been put in place for us to help promote a friendly and positive environment for the users here.</p>
                    <p><strong>It is important in these first steps to take it slow and not jump into any moderation without guidance from the rest of the team</strong>.</p>
                    <p>For the first little while, new moderators will look into some basic locking and moving of topics. If you find a thread that is in one part of the forums but should be in another, tell us where you want to move it to and we'll tell you yes or no, and if no, we'll explain why. If you find a thread that you think needs to be locked, explain why you think it needs to be locked and we'll talk about it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Discord Channels</strong></p>
                    <p>We have our own private Discord channel set up where we can talk about forum moderation, ban appeals, or just generally chat, share memes and talk about our day. It's not a requirement to join, but it's nice to have everyone there. In the past we operated an email chain, which was often problematic.</p>

                    <p>Waypoint allows the ability to move topics between any forum a moderator has permission to move them to.</p>
                    <p>To move a topic click the <strong>Pencil</strong> (or <strong>edit</strong>) button at the very end of the topic title. This will change the title into an input box and reveal a dropdown menu where you can chose which forum to move the topic to. Select the appropriate forum from the dropdown and then press the <strong>tick</strong> button underneath to confirm. To cancel your decision, click the <strong>cross</strong> button.</p>
                    <p><em>IMAGE</em></p>
                    <p>On confirming a topic move nothing will immediately change visually, you will need to refresh the page to make sure you didn't select and incorrect forum.</p>

                    To lock a topic click the <strong>wrench</strong> icon at the right hand side of the topic, where the vertical date scroll resides, and from the dropdown menu select <strong>close topic</strong>.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that closing a topic does not prevent replies to that topic from being edited. You can also manually lock a post to prevent further edits. At the bottom of the post click the <em>3 dot</em>* button which will expand additional options for that post. Click the <strong>wrench icon</strong> on the post and select <strong>close post</strong> from the dropdown menu.</p>

                    <p>Posts found to be in breach of the forum rules are edited with a pre-set template relating to the offence. To edit a post, click the <strong>Edit</strong> (or <strong>pencil</strong>) icon at the bottom of the offending post.</p>
                    <p>If the post in question is the first post in a topic then that topic will be locked for consistency. Depending on on the nature of the infraction, a user may PM a member of the moderation team and ask to create a new topic on the same subject as long as it does not contain any of the previous infractions or violate any of the forum rules.</p>
                    <p>Currently to apply the standard template is as follows:</p>
                    <p>1 - Edit the post, highlight all the text, click the <strong>Cog/Settings icon</strong> at the end of the post editor toolbar and then select "<strong>Hide Details</strong>" from the dropdown<br>
                    <em>IMAGE</em></p>
                    <p>2 - Change the "<strong>Summary</strong>" text inside the resulting BBCode to "<strong>Original post. Click at your own discretion.</strong>"<br>
                    3 - Add a staff notice with the reason, e.g. "<strong>Please do not post spam</strong>"<br>
                    4 - Ban if necessary<br>
                    5 - Send warning/ban message (make sure to mark the "<strong>This is an official warning.</strong>" checkbox)</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Any warning or ban message sent to a user should include the list of edited posts pertaining to the warning/ban, for logging purposes</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>A final edit should resemble something like this:<br>
                        <em>IMAGE</em></p>
                    <p>Depending on the offense, other posts in the same topic may also need to be edited - this can be the case if an offending post has been quoted and contains inappropriate or offensive remarks. The quote box itself should be preserved, but any text inside should be removed. Take a fake quote below as example</p>

                    <p>When a post is edited, either by staff or by a user, a new revision is created and older revisions preserved. These revisions can be reviewed by staff and posts call be rolled back to a previous revision if necessary - this is particularly useful for cases when a user has modified a post but a public record of offense wants to be kept.</p>
                    <p>If a post has any revisions available you can see a colored <strong>Pencil icon</strong> at the top right hand corner of the post, next to the post date. The number denotes how many revisions are available. Clicking the icon generates a popup where you can browse through all revisions (in 3 different formats) and choose to revert to a specific revision, hide a revision or edit the post again.</p>

                    <p>When acting on a reported post, a post brought to your attention or a post you have seen while browsing the forums, it's a good idea to first of all check the user's <strong><a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/t/moderation-101-wip/23626/7">Account History</a></strong> and see if they have had any moderation action taken against them in the past or present. Sometimes you may find that the user is currently serving a ban and the post was simply overlooked when the ban was issued.</p>
                    <p>In those cases all you would have to do is edit the post and note it in the user's notes. Other times you may find that a user is already on their last chance having previously served a 14 day ban. You can go a few ways in situations like this: if their last ban was quite a while back or if the offense isn't too severe, send a warning but make sure to replace the last line of the PM with the last chance text from the <strong>response templates</strong>.  [TBA]</p>
                    <p>If the offense would merit a step up the ban ladder, simply set a permanent ban and log the post. You can also issue a repeat ban rather than a permanent. No need to send a PM for a permanent ban. Users may often contact the team for clarity on permanent bans - you are welcome to then send details of the posts they were banned for and direct them to the <strong>appeals process</strong> [TBA] should they wish to appeal the ban.</p>
                    <p>As always, do feel free to check in with the team in Discord if you have concerns or are looking for a second opinion on user or post.</p>

                    <p>Appeals themselves are handled in quarterly batches (roughly every 3 months). After an unsuccessful appeal, users may appeal for a second time. For the time being, until further notice is given, the entire ban appeals process is being handled by the moderation team.</p>

                    <p>Hi there!</p>
                    <p>It is our pleasure to inform you that after careful consideration, your appeal was successfully approved and you may return to full participation on the forums. However, before the ban is lifted, you must respond and agree to comply with the following conditions once you have been reinstated.</p>
                    <p>Once reinstated, if your account requires moderation the following ban progression applies:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>1st offense will result in a 7-day ban.</li>
                    <li>2nd offense will result in a 14-day ban, plus a message that your next offense will result in a permanent ban.</li>
                    <li>3rd offense will result in a permanent ban without the possibility of appealing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Bear in mind that the moderation team will continue to maintain discretion regarding ban lengths. Once you agree to these terms, you will be reinstated and you will be free to participate on the forums again.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your patience and cooperation!</p>

                    <p>The general policy on discussions about modded content is that it is forbidden, unless mods for the given game in question have been officially authorized. As of writing, as a rule of thumb this means almost all discussion of game mods is forbidden, with the notable exception being Halo Custom Edition. The situation may change with the release of Halo MCC for PC.</p>
                    <p>Note that sentiments along the lines of "I wish this game had official mod support" are fine to express as long as they don't make references to any existing, unauthorized mods.</p>
                    <p>Below is a list of common mod discussion topics and whether they are allowed or forbidden.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="xbox-hardware-mods-forbidden-2" class="anchor" href="#xbox-hardware-mods-forbidden-2"></a>Xbox hardware mods: forbidden</h4>
                    <p>Use of modified consoles is an activity forbidden by Microsoft, and therefore discussion of console mods has no place on Waypoint.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="halo-mods-on-xbox-forbidden-3" class="anchor" href="#halo-mods-on-xbox-forbidden-3"></a>Halo mods on Xbox: forbidden</h4>
                    <p>Since there is no official support for Halo mods on the Xbox, this is obviously forbidden.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="halo-wars-2-forbidden-4" class="anchor" href="#halo-wars-2-forbidden-4"></a>Halo Wars 2: forbidden</h4>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="halo-custom-edition-allowed-5" class="anchor" href="#halo-custom-edition-allowed-5"></a>Halo Custom Edition: allowed</h4>
                    <p>Halo Custom Edition is a supplementary set of tools released for the PC release of Halo CE by the developer Gearbox Software. As such, discussing Halo Custom Edition mods is fine.<br>
                    However, it is worth noting that in advising how to play Halo Custom Edition, people may give resources for pirating Halo PC. Since promoting piracy is of course separately not allowed on Waypoint, this is still ban-able and something to look out for.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="spv3-allowed-6" class="anchor" href="#spv3-allowed-6"></a>SPV3: allowed</h4>
                    <p>SPV3 is the one Halo Custom Edition mod that is the most often discussed. As such discussing it is allowed.<br>
                    It is worth noting that particular downloads of the mod come with a copy of Halo CE included, for people who somehow have a CD key but not copy of the game. This essentially constitutes as piracy, which means that linking to SPV3 downloads might be forbidden.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="eldewrito-forbidden-7" class="anchor" href="#eldewrito-forbidden-7"></a>ElDewrito: forbidden</h4>
                    <p>ElDewrito is a mod for Halo Onlineâ€”a cancelled game aimed at the Russian market. This is an unauthorized mod based on leaked assets for a game that isn't even available in any official capacity. Hence discussion about ElDewrito is forbidden, and furthermore any suggestion that Halo Online is obtainable should be treated as promoting piracy.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="project-cartographer-forbidden-8" class="anchor" href="#project-cartographer-forbidden-8"></a>Project Cartographer: forbidden</h4>
                    <p>Project Cartographer is a mod for Halo 2 Vista that restores online play after the game servers were shut down. The website for this game contains a download link with the full game, which is again piracy.</p>
                    <h4>
                    <a name="fan-games-and-halo-mods-in-other-games-allowed-9" class="anchor" href="#fan-games-and-halo-mods-in-other-games-allowed-9"></a>Fan games and Halo mods in other games: allowed</h4>
                    <p>Fan games and Halo themed mods in non-Halo games are generally allowed as long as they follow the Xbox Game Content Usage Rules. This roughly means that they can't contain assets from official games, must be free to download, and shouldn't contain inappropriate content (e.g., sexual content, discriminatory content, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Below are some known fan projects and their presently known status.<br>
                    Installation 01: <strong>allowed</strong><br>
                    Project Contingency: <strong>allowed</strong><br>
